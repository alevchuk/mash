= Requirements =

  Only Ruby and R (with Biostrings package) are required.

  The software was tested with the following versions:
   * Ruby 1.8.5
   * R 2.9.0
   * Biostrings 2.12.1

  Note: Other versions are likely to work as well

  To install Biostrings open the R session (just run "R") are run:
    source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
    biocLite("Biostrings")



= Installation =

  1. Move the entire clustalw-to-html-0.9 directory where it's readable by all:
    cd ..
    sudo mv clustalw-to-html-0.9 /opt/clustalw-to-html-0.9
    sudo chmod -R o+r            /opt/clustalw-to-html-0.9
    sudo chmod +x                /opt/clustalw-to-html-0.9/highlight-regions.R
    sudo chmod +x              /opt/clustalw-to-html-0.9/filter-hmmpfam-output
    sudo chmod +x                /opt/clustalw-to-html-0.9/clustalw-to-fasta
    sudo chmod +x                /opt/clustalw-to-html-0.9/fasta-to-html
    sudo chmod +x                /opt/clustalw-to-html-0.9/clustalw-to-html

  2. Make symbolic links to /usr/local/bin where it is in the PATH of everyone:
    sudo ln -s /opt/clustalw-to-html-0.9/clustalw-to-fasta /usr/local/bin/
    sudo ln -s /opt/clustalw-to-html-0.9/fasta-to-html     /usr/local/bin/
    sudo ln -s /opt/clustalw-to-html-0.9/clustalw-to-html  /usr/local/bin/
    sudo ln -s /opt/clustalw-to-html-0.9/filter-hmmpfam-output /usr/local/bin/



= Run tests =

  mkdir ~/tmp-clustalw-to-html-test
  cd ~/tmp-clustalw-to-html-test
  /opt/clustalw-to-html-0.9/housekeeping/run-tests

  # You should see no errors and some nice HTML files

  rm -rf ~/tmp-clustalw-to-html-test
