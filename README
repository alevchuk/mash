  ClustalW  - a standard format for storing multiple sequence alignments.
  FASTA     - all sequences should have the same length. "-" represents a gap.

OUTPUT: 
  HTML file    - contains sequences.
  JSON file(s) - highlighting info for 1 or more scoring methods.

REQUIREMENTS:
  All code is written in R.

  Required R libraries:
    * seqinr
    * rjson
    * Biostrings

  Results are viewable in a web browser.

FEATURES:
