    Can only highlight residues based on their Physico-Chemical Properties.
    Cannot highlight well-conserved residues or Pfam domains.

    Highlights well-conserved residues.

    In T-Coffee the HTML generator is coupled with the internal data-strucures
    used generating the alignments.

    Alignment tools that T-Coffee calls (e.g. clustalw) become subject to
    the limits of T-Coffee (e.g. No Alignment of more than 1000 sequences).
